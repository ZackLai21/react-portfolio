# Portfolio using React

This portfolio was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

I used React as the front-end framework to build this portfolio to showcase my skills and projects to the potential employers. This portfolio has four tabs: About me, Projects, Contact and Resume.
